# RetoSemestral ArrayManipulation
Instrucciones:

You are given a list(1-indexed) of size n, initialized with zeroes. You have to perform m operations on the list and output the maximum of final values of all the n elements in the list. For every operation, you are given three integers a, b and k and you have to add value to all the elements ranging from index to (both inclusive). For example, consider a list of size 3. The initial list would be = [0, 0, 0] and after performing the update O(a,b,k)= (2, 3, 30) , the new list would be = [0, 30, 30]. Here, we've added value 30 to elements between indices 2 and 3. Note the index of the list starts from 1.
